The Licensor reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the Licensee, in which case the Licensee agrees to cooperate fully with the Licensor’s defense of such claims.

This indemnification obligation survives the termination or revocation of this license and applies to any acts or omissions by the Licensee related to the software, regardless of whether such acts or omissions occur before or after the license period.

The Licensee acknowledges that the Licensor makes no representations or warranties regarding the compliance of the software with any specific laws or regulations and assumes no liability for the Licensee’s use thereof.

The Licensor reserves the right to amend, modify, or update the terms of this license at any time, at their sole discretion, to address changes in legal, regulatory, or operational requirements or to ensure the continued functionality and integrity of the software.
